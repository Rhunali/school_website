          <p>When you use the Website www.KidsNation.com (A unit of Kids Nation Education Private Limited), we collect and
            store your personal information which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to
            provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and
            features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and

            for achieving this purpose.</p>

            information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. Kids Nation and its
            affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this

          <h4 class="header4 mt-4 mb-4">COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
          <p>A “cookie” is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web browser so it can be later read
            back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a
            given user. We place both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer’s hard drive. The cookies do not
            contain any of your personally identifiable information.</p>

            information about our user base as a whole. Kids Nation may use this information in our marketing and
            advertising services.</p>
          <p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Website. When customers
            click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on
            our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure
            the effectiveness of our customer communications.</p>
          <p>“Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer
            certain features that are only available through the use of a “cookie”.</p>
          <p>We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also
            help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning
            that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to
            decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features
            on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.</p>
