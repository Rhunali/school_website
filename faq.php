                    Daily e-notes are provided to parents in first fortnight of
                    enrollment. At the end of every month an ‘Orientation
                    Session’, is arranged for the parent to give a detailed report
                    as to how their child is settling in along with a brief
                    presentation on the overall schedule for the year . <br />
                    "Phase-In" refers to the first several days of class. Children
                    are gradually acclimated to school and classroom procedures
                    during the transition period in which they meet their new
                    teachers and classmates. Separation anxiety is normal as most
                    children go through this typical developmental stage, which
                    generally gets phased out within a fortnight.

                    and an experienced assistant teacher are present in every

                    Learning self-control, respect for others, and responsibility
                    are all part of the discipline process. All hours will be
                    spent using constructive techniques of discipline to ensure
                    that kids understand the expectations for behaviour at school.
                    Teachers will serve as role models for sharing, waiting,
                    taking turns, problem-solving, impulse control, and
                    verbalising thoughts in order to help kids learn how to
